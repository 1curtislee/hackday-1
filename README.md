  Welcome to the official repository for the IESD Hack Day event.
</p>


## **Getting Started**

This repository has the resources to get you prepared for this month's Hack Day event. 

**No starter code provided**

If you have any questions, please ask on our [Slack](https://ie-sd.slack.com). We welcome everyone to our Slack, so don't be afraid to join! Have fun coding!

**<a href="https://join.slack.com/t/ie-sd/shared_invite/enQtNTY1NDU3MTg4NDE5LWZiNjViZmQ0ODhmN2Q0NTg1NWQwZTcyODEyYmM4ZGYxNjZkM2UxYzU5OTZkMDY4YzljYjIwZGY4YmEyNzRlNjA">Join our Slack!</a>**

## **Concepts to Review**

This section provides you some concepts to review that will make your time working on the Hack Day project much easier.
- ASCII text strings
- String manipulation
- Unit testing 
- Git & GitHub

## **Technology** 

This Hack Day challenge is language agnostic. We will not force you to use a specific stack. Your tech stack is dependent on the composition of your team.

## **Challenge**
**Description**: DNA is a very stable and compact storage medium.  The language of DNA consists of four bases, each of which may be thought of as a character in the DNA alphabet.  For our purposes, these characters (in order) are: A, T, G, and C.  We would like to store digital data in DNA!
 
**Challenge:** Construct a program in the language of your choice that satisfies as many of the following objectives as possible.

## **Tasks**

**Objective 1:** (20 pts) Provide a mechanism to encode arbitrary standard ASCII text strings as DNA.  Recall that ASCII characters have numeric values of 0 to 255.

Input: a, Output: TGAT              

Input: cat, Output: TGACTGATTCTA

**Objective 2:** (30 pts) Using your favorite unit test framework, write the unit tests you feel are necessary to adequately test the code you wrote as your answer to object one.

**Objective 3:** (30 pts) Create a simple user interface for users to interact with your program - input/output for your program. 

**Objective 4:** (30 pts) RNA is very similar to DNA, but it replaces T with U.  Make your program capable of encoding as either DNA or RNA.

**Objective 5:** (40 pts) Provide an interface for identifying standard ASCII text substrings encoded as DNA; the interface should provide the zero-based index where the substring begins or -1 if it does not exist.

**Objective 6:** (40 pts) DNA actually consists of two, complementary strands that are attached in such a way that every A matches T and G matches C (and the inverses).  Given a complementary strand of DNA, output the ASCII equivalent of the primary strand.

Examples:

Input: ACTGACTAAGAT, Output: cat

**Objective 7:** (50 pts) Add the ability to log all requests. Store the input, the time it took to convert it from ASCII text to DNA or RNA, output and a time stamp. 

**Objective 8:** (80 pts) Given two (single) strands of DNA, provide an interface that allows finding the longest common subsequence of the two. Recall that common subsequences need not be consecutive.

## **Approach**
1. Using the language of your choice, please implement as many of the objectives as you can in the time provided.
2. Submit your code by a public github repository. Your repository should include instructions on how to set up, compile & run your application.  You can assume your instructions will be read by a developer.
3. Winner will be announced the day after, each team will be provided a PDF delineating their scores.

## **Innovation** 
Have an idea for an innovative feature for this project? Each accepted innovation that is completed will earn you a total of 50 points.  

**Innovations must meet the following criteria:**
- Must have completed at least 70% of all objectives
- Must be a new idea (creative and original) - talk to an organizer first
- Must not cause any regression in user experience

## **Scoring**

Based on the point system under tasks, you will also be on the hook for an **additional 10 points**. Your project will be reviewed and given points (not deducted points) if any of the factors below are met or exceeded. 

**Factors in scoring:**
- Code simplicity
- Documentation
- Code commenting
- UI Design / Visualization Design
- Presentation
- Teamwork
- Collaboration (Git & GitHub commit messages, PRs, comments, review, etc)

Simplicity will be favored over complex/clever code. Commenting code will also be highly favored. 

## Submission

Once you are ready to submit, please submit a link for your repository in the Slack channel #general - so everyone can take a look.  

**Presenting** 

- You will be given 3-5 minutes to present
- Make sure you repository reflects all the names of your team members
- Make sure all the tasks you were able to complete and your total score based on the tasks you were able to complete is reflected ** important ** 
- Use your list of completed tasks to guide your presentation
- Walk the audience through what you were able to complete
- Walk the audience through your design
- State what you think your team did well
